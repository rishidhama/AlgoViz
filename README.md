# AlgoViz

An interactive web application built with React.js and Tailwind CSS that visualizes various algorithms through step-by-step animations. Learn algorithms by watching them in action with real-time visualizations.


## Features

### Algorithm Categories

#### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort** - Simple comparison-based sorting with O(n²) complexity
- **Selection Sort** - Finds minimum element and places it at beginning
- **Insertion Sort** - Builds sorted array one element at a time
- **Merge Sort** - Divide and conquer algorithm with O(n log n) complexity
- **Quick Sort** - Pivot-based sorting with average O(n log n) complexity
- **Heap Sort** - Uses binary heap data structure for sorting

#### Searching Algorithms
- **Linear Search** - Sequential search through each element
- **Binary Search** - Efficient search in sorted arrays with O(log n) complexity
- **Ternary Search** - Divides search space into three parts

#### Graph Algorithms
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** - Explores all neighbors at current depth first
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** - Explores as far as possible along each branch
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** - Finds shortest path from source to all nodes
- **Prim's Algorithm** - Finds minimum spanning tree by growing from start node
- **Kruskal's Algorithm** - Finds minimum spanning tree by adding edges in weight order

#### Tree Algorithms
- **Inorder Traversal** - Left → Root → Right (visits nodes in sorted order for BST)
- **Preorder Traversal** - Root → Left → Right (useful for creating tree copies)
- **Postorder Traversal** - Left → Right → Root (useful for deleting trees)
- **BST Insert** - Inserts new nodes while maintaining BST properties
- **BST Search** - Searches for values using BST properties for efficiency

#### Dynamic Programming
- **Fibonacci** - Demonstrates memoization with recursive Fibonacci calculation
- **Knapsack Problem** - 0/1 Knapsack optimization with memoization
- **Matrix Chain Multiplication** - Finds optimal way to multiply matrix chain
